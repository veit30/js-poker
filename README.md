# js-poker (WIP)
Poker with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## Running
Run application with `npm start`.

## Current Status
- simple poker setting rendering:
  - Table
  - Cards (card back is not final)
  - Chips
- MVC-Pattern implementation
- Hand solver (not fully tested yet but works pretty well)
- Animations for card dealing and chip calling

## Planned
- finalize card back (almost done)
- error handling
- tests
- user Inputs (already started)
- server client implementation to play in local network
- game flow control:
  - start screen and menu
  - (avatars; can be quite funny for multiplayer)
  - poker functionality (calling, passing, raising, checking, etc.)
- more customizing control for Cards, Chips, Table and more
- build cross platform desktop application with Electron JS
