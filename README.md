# js-poker (WIP)
Poker with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## Current Status
- simple poker setting rendering:
  - Table
  - Cards (card back is not final)
  - Chips
- MVC-Pattern implementation
- Hand solver (not fully tested yet but works pretty well)
- Animations for card dealing and chip calling

## Planned
- finalize card back
- Error handling
- Tests
- User Inputs
- Game flow control:
  - start screen and menu
  - (avatars; can be quite funny for multiplayer)
  - poker functionality (calling,passing,raising,checking,etc.)
- Bot player (maybe pretty simple one)
- more customizing control for Cards, Chips, Table and more
- Modes:
  - Singleplayer (against Bots)
  - Multiplayer

## Plans for the future
Build an Desktop application and or an app (iOS and Android) to play poker on your deserved device (Electron, NativeScript, React Native, Proton Native).
